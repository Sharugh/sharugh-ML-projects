Machine Learning Projects üß†üíª

Welcome to my collection of machine learning projects! In these projects, I applied various machine learning algorithms, data preprocessing techniques, and visualization tools to solve real-world problems and make predictions. Each project demonstrates my skills in data science, predictive modeling, and machine learning, with a focus on industries such as oil and gas, environmental sustainability, and more.
